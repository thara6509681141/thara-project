# fish-eat-game

## Overview
**Fish Eat Game** is a 3D web-based game where the player takes on the role of a fish. The objective of the game is to eat food items scattered throughout various scenes, while avoiding being eaten by other fish. The game ends when the player is caught by another fish, and the player must restart. The game includes sound effects for eating food and background music to enhance the experience.

## Features
- **3D Graphics**: Built with **Three.js** for rendering 3D models and environments.
- **Blender Models**: Custom 3D models created in **Blender**.
- **Sound Effects**: Includes sound effects when eating food and background music for gameplay.
- **Game Mechanics**: Avoid other fish while eating the food in the scene. If the player is caught, the game will restart.
- **Web-based**: Playable directly in a browser.
